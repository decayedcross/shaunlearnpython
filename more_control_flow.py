	Pythonâ€™s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence. For example (no pun intended):

If you need to modify the sequence you are iterating over while inside the loop (for example to duplicate selected items), it is recommended that you first make a copy. 
Iterating over a sequence does not implicitly make a copy. The slice notation makes this especially convenient:
